# Data Parsing App
### Get started
To start, clone the project `git clone <project>`. \
After it, start build set up with `sbt`. \
And run a server (in sbt) `run` or `reStart`, `reStart` is better. \
Congratulations, you've started the server: `RestApi bound to http://0.0.0.0:8080/`.\
If you've used `reStart` you can stop the server with `reStop`.\
